# Mapping_Earthquakes

This repository functioned to map recent earthquakes.

The Leaflet library was used to create the Interactive Maps.

Mapbox API was used to gather certain base map styles. 

The earthquakes were mapped and circle markers were created for each one. A popup was linked describing the location of the earthquake as well as each earthquake was scaled and colored based on the magnitude. Additionally, tectonic plates were mapped to give more insight as to the location and magnitudes of the world's earthquakes. 

Finally, a webpage was created using HTML. The webpage was interactive (thanks to Leaflet) and allowed users to select certain background map styles and toggle various map information.
