# Mapping_Earthquakes

This repository functioned to map recent earthquakes.

The Leaflet library was used to create the Interactive Maps.

Mapbox API was used to gather certain base map styles. 

The earthquakes were mapped and circle markers were created for each one. A popup was linked describing the location of the earthquake as well as each earthquake was scaled and colored based on the magnitude. Additionally, tectonic plates were mapped to give more insight as to the location and magnitudes of the world's earthquakes. 

Finally, a local webpage was created using HTML which imported in Leaflet and the other libraries. The webpage was interactive (thanks to Leaflet) and allowed users to select certain background map styles and toggle various map information.

Below is a screenshot of the Earthquake Map. When the webpage is running, you can see from the screenshot in the top right there is a drop down menu which gives the user the ability to customize how they would like the maps to look (as well as toggle certain infomration on/off).
